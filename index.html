    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>Being a graduate student pursuing Data Analytics as a specialization, I have opted for ITMD 541 as it will help me examine core web technologies that are integral in the creation of web-based applications typically
        delivered in a browser. The course will cover fundamental web protocols, web application architectures, markup, and scripting languages. A focus will be placed on writing modern, standards-compliant JavaScript and how it is used to interact with HTML and CSS to enable rich user
        interfaces and communication with other services. Current frameworks, libraries, and tools will also be explored.</p>
